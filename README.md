# TianGong LCA Database


 Welcome to the official repository of **TianGong LCA Database**. Constructed by a community of industry experts, the Tiangong LCA database has brought together unit processe data in China, with additional data being added on an ongoing basis. Tiangong LCA Database adheres to the basic principles of **open and free**, **traceable and trustworthy**, and **continuously updated and expanded**.

- **Open & Free**: Our database is openly accessible and free for all, promoting the democratization of sustainability data to foster global collaboration and innovation.
- **Traceable & Credible**: Built on a foundation of transparency and reliability, our database ensures every piece of data is meticulously verified and clearly sourced, offering trusted information for accurate assessments.
- **Updating & Expanding**: Our database continuously grows, adding new data and broadening its coverage. While prioritizing expansion, we remain vigilant in ensuring accuracy, making careful updates and corrections as needed.

To make it easier for you to gain a deeper understanding of and conduct LCA using the Tiangong LCA database, we have provided this supplemental resource library. Whether you are seeking insights, detailed datasets, or supporting documentation, our resource library is ready to assist you in enhancing your research, projects, and explorations within the Tinker community.

Besides, we have established an internationally universal life cycle data sharing node, the Soda4LCA, which possesses the technical foundation to connect with international data platforms such as the Global LCA Data Access (GLAD) of the United Nations and the Life Cycle Data Network (LCDN) of the European Union.
